# Project Description:
The goals of our project include creating an easy to use and eye-pleasing user interface and uploading and outputting data. By achieving these goals, we are hoping to provide something that will help identify rib fracture patterns and the variables that influence their occurrence and severity.  This is significant because statistical analysis can reveal patterns in rib fractures, such as the anterior breaks being more common in a certain demographic. Additionally,  compiling these cases together will allow anthropology students to study rib trauma cases that they otherwise might not see in real life. Thus, our intended audience is the specific anthropology student who commissioned this project, but also future students. Medical professionals, orthopedic doctors in particular for example, may also benefit from this software and the information it may provide.    

The main functionality of our project is rooted in being able to have user input for the raw rib data and then being able to export that data in a usable format. This entails making a user interface which has fields for each rib fracture case, such as the position of the fracture, the age of the patient, demographic information, and other relevant patient history. In addition to manual user input, the software should also be able to read a file set in a specific format to obtain the data. Similarly, there should be functionality to export data, likely in the form of xlsx or csv files. Finally, a comparison algorithm will need to be generated and used in order to find similar patient cases. This algorithm will compare the types of fractures with patient histories and demographics.    

The users will be able to input, store, and access collected data with ease. Users will also be able to see correlations and make empirically founded interpretations rather than subjective interpretations. Sharing data amongst users will also become easier. The data will not have to be written down, will be better organized to allow for statistical analysis to find patterns between bone breaks.

This book is about human osteology, or the study of human bones. This book covers the entire skeletal system and works with it using forensic osteology. There is an entire section dedicated specifically to ribs, and many forensic cases that focus on studying different parts of the skeletal system.

This was a study done on rib fractures to compare risk factors, treatment modalities, and outcomes based on patients with flail chest and non flail chest post blunt trauma. Patients were analyzed and it was concluded that flail chest is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. While the main focus of this study was whether a patient had a flail chest or not, it also analyzed other characteristics such as age.

This article describes a study conducted on rib fractures in order to find certain patterns. Specifically, the study draws a connection between the location of a rib fracture, and the severity of this fracture. It also assesses the correlation between this, and complications developing after the break.

This was a study done on rib fractures to try and find patterns in fractures based on demographics. The goal was to better understand the frequency and location of rib fractures. The results of the study showed that some demographic features, such as age and sex, do in fact have a role in rib fractures.

This article assessed a number of variables in rib fractures of trauma patients and studied the effects that these different traits had. Severity of the injury, location of the injury, age, and gender were all analyzed. The study concluded that location has the largest effect on morbidity and mortality, and the location of a rib fracture should be checked in order to determine the possibility of these factors and decrease complications.
